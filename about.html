          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p>
            As the Northern Colorado Tech community continues to grow, we've found a need for
            a unified calendar. Most people in the tech industry wear many hats, so a single 
            group may not cover all the interests of an individual. "We" (including you, the reader)
            serve to provide a single point of reference for all of the tech groups in Colorado 
            north of the Denver metro (we'll call this latitudes north of Boulder county for now).
          </p>

          <h3>Community Groups</h3>
          <p>

            and playful computing practitioners. Meets monthly to share knowledge and collaborate
            on security topics.</li>
          </ul>
